The purpose of this project is to define a branded styleguide for people to import and use in their projects.

### How do I view Blueprints documentation?

You have three options.

#### Option 1

#### Option 2

Presuming you have Docker and Docker Compose setup on your machine, the following command will get you up and running:

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

Once it finishes the building process, the styleguide will be available on:

[http://192.168.99.100:3000](http://192.168.99.100:3000)

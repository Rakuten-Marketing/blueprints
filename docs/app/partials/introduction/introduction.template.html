    <h2>What is Blueprints?</h2>

    <p>
      An UI framework using <em>Bootstrap 3</em> as its foundation. Created in that way primarily
      focusing on look and feel, described as a long living styleguide that can evolve over time
      and empower developers to build application pages quickly whilst conforming with a consistent
      branding that is agreed and defined.

    <h2>Start using this styleguide</h2>

    <p>
      You have several options to include the distribution files into your project but the result
      should be the same: get a copy of the stylesheet file and the javascript into your main HTML
      document.
    </p>
    <p>There are two recommended options:</p>

    <h4>Option 1:</h4>

    <p>
      Install Blueprints as a node module and compile a unified css from our scss files. You can
      specify a release version or a branch
    </p>

    <div hljs hljs-language="javascript">
// Add this dependency to package.json
{
  "dependencies": "git+ssh://git@github.private.linksynergy.com/SD/blueprints.git#v1.0.0-rc.10"
}</div>

    </br>
    <p>
      Then include dist/blueprints.min.js in your build and in your app's scss file
      `@import 'node_modules/blueprints/src/blueprints.scss';` (or only include the components you
      want if you need to optimize). Then in each file where you want to (and you should want to)
      you can include our size and color variables and helpers/mixins. This will help your custom
      CSS keep to the same rules and measurement Blueprints applies.
    </p>

    <h4>Option 2:</h4>

    <p>
      Include the precompiled CSS and JS files from the node module (or bower component) in your
      app's HTML. This allows you to update versions by just changing the pinned version in your
      package.json
    </p>

    <div hljs hljs-language="html" hljs-no-escape>
// Add these to your HTML
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="node_modules/blueprints/dist/blueprints.min.css"&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="node_modules/blueprints/dist/blueprints.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    </div>

    <h4>Option 3:</h4>

    <p>
      Include compiled CSS and JS from our S3 bucket (https://blueprints-prod.s3.amazonaws.com).
      Each released version gets its dist folder uploaded to a directory sharing that name on that
      S3 bucket.
    </p>

    <div hljs hljs-language="html" hljs-no-escape>
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://blueprints-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/{insert version here}/blueprints.min.css"&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://blueprints-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/{insert version here}/blueprints.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

> NOTE: This is very much work in progress and is not ready for production use. But feel free to take a peak and explore ðŸ˜Ž

The purpose of this project is to define a branded styleguide for people to import and use in their projects.

### How do I view Blueprints documentation?

You have three options.

#### Option 1

http://10.133.192.166:3000/

#### Option 2

Before you proceed with this option, you'll need to make sure that you have a valid SSH key in the project root directory.
This is to ensure, that Docker can install private dependencies from our Github Enterprise.

```bash
 ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "`whoami`@rakuten.com" -f deploy.key -N ''
```

You also need to add `deploy.key.pub` to your Github SSH keys list.

Assuming you have Docker and Docker Compose setup on your machine, the following command will get you up and running:

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

Once it finishes the building process, the styleguide will be available on:

[http://192.168.99.100:3000](http://192.168.99.100:3000)

The IP of the Docker host may be different, but you can check that:

```bash
$ docker-machine ip default
```

#### Option 3

Feeling adventurous? No worries, got you covered.

    <h3>What is Blueprints?</h3>

    <p>
      You could think of Blueprints as a UI framework, primarily focused on look and feel, or
      in other words - CSS. It's a long living styleguide that can evolve over time and empower
      developers to build application pages quickly whilst conforming with a consistent branding
      that is agreed and defined.
    </p>

    <h3>How is it built?</h3>

    <p>
      Blueprints is essentially built on top of <em>Bootstrap 3</em>. This allows us to use
      solid foundations (a range of components, grid system and documentation)
      that almost every developer is familiar with, but adopt it to our organisation needs.

    <h3>Great. How do I get started?</h3>

      installation instructions.
